# üìÇ Data Folder

This directory contains all datasets used in the project **"Graph-Based Light-Curve Features for Robust Transient Classification"**.

---

## üìò Overview

The datasets in this folder contain **light curve time-series data** for both **transient** and **non-transient** astronomical objects.  
They are used to extract graph-based features and train classification models capable of distinguishing transient events.

All files were originally obtained from a public GitHub repository containing light-curve data.
